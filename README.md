# Collection of Powershell scripts
also available via https://dybbugt.no/fieldnotes/powershell/
 
Here you will find various powershell scripts/commands that can be useful in various circumstances.
The content list below show the current available scripts for you to find.

I will add more as I make them, and if they are suited to be generalized and made available to others.
If I find some useful scripts elsewhere, I will add those aswell – with notes on who is the creator.

Hope you find the content useful.
